## MD029 - Ordered list item prefix | 有序列表项前缀

Tags: ol

Aliases: ol-prefix

Parameters: style ("one", "ordered", "one_or_ordered"; default "one_or_ordered")

This rule is triggered on ordered lists that do not either start with '1.' or
do not have a prefix that increases in numerical order (depending on the
configured style).

Example valid list if the style is configured as 'one':

```markdown
1. Do this.
1. Do that.
1. Done.
```

Example valid list if the style is configured as 'ordered':

```markdown
1. Do this.
2. Do that.
3. Done.
```

Both examples are valid when the style is configured as 'one_or_ordered'.

Example invalid list for all styles:

```markdown
1. Do this.
3. Done.
```

This rule supports 0-prefixing ordered list items for uniform indentation:

```markdown
...
08. Item
09. Item
10. Item
11. Item
...
```

## MD030 - Spaces after list markers | 列表标记后的空格

Tags: ol, ul, whitespace

Aliases: list-marker-space

Parameters: ul_single, ol_single, ul_multi, ol_multi (number; default 1)

This rule checks for the number of spaces between a list marker (e.g. '`-`',
'`*`', '`+`' or '`1.`') and the text of the list item.

The number of spaces checked for depends on the document style in use, but the
default is 1 space after any list marker:

```markdown
* Foo
* Bar
* Baz

1. Foo
1. Bar
1. Baz

1. Foo
   * Bar
1. Baz
```

A document style may change the number of spaces after unordered list items
and ordered list items independently, as well as based on whether the content
of every item in the list consists of a single paragraph, or multiple
paragraphs (including sub-lists and code blocks).

For example, the style guide at
<https://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/#spaces-after-list-marker>
specifies that 1 space after the list marker should be used if every item in
the list fits within a single paragraph, but to use 2 or 3 spaces (for ordered
and unordered lists respectively) if there are multiple paragraphs of content
inside the list:

```markdown
* Foo
* Bar
* Baz
```

vs.

```markdown
*   Foo

    Second paragraph

*   Bar
```

or

```markdown
1.  Foo

    Second paragraph

1.  Bar
```

To fix this, ensure the correct number of spaces are used after list marker
for your selected document style.

## MD031 - Fenced code blocks should be surrounded by blank lines | 受控代码块应该用空行包围

Tags: code, blank_lines

Aliases: blanks-around-fences

This rule is triggered when fenced code blocks are either not preceded or not
followed by a blank line:

````markdown
Some text
```
Code block
```

```
Another code block
```
Some more text
````

To fix this, ensure that all fenced code blocks have a blank line both before
and after (except where the block is at the beginning or end of the document):

````markdown
Some text

```
Code block
```

```
Another code block
```

Some more text
````

Rationale: Aside from aesthetic reasons, some parsers, including kramdown, will
not parse fenced code blocks that don't have blank lines before and after them.


## MD032 - Lists should be surrounded by blank lines | 列表应该用空行包围

Tags: bullet, ul, ol, blank_lines

Aliases: blanks-around-lists

This rule is triggered when lists (of any kind) are either not preceded or not
followed by a blank line:

```markdown
Some text
* Some
* List

1. Some
2. List
Some text
```

To fix this, ensure that all lists have a blank line both before and after
(except where the block is at the beginning or end of the document):

```markdown
Some text

* Some
* List

1. Some
2. List

Some text
```

Rationale: Aside from aesthetic reasons, some parsers, including kramdown, will
not parse lists that don't have blank lines before and after them.

Note: List items without hanging indents are a violation of this rule; list
items with hanging indents are okay:

```markdown
* This is
not okay

* This is
  okay
```

## MD033 - Inline HTML | 内联HTML

Tags: html

Aliases: no-inline-html

Parameters: allowed_elements (array of string; default empty)

This rule is triggered whenever raw HTML is used in a markdown document:

```markdown
<h1>Inline HTML heading</h1>
```

To fix this, use 'pure' markdown instead of including raw HTML:

```markdown
# Markdown heading
```

Rationale: Raw HTML is allowed in markdown, but this rule is included for
those who want their documents to only include "pure" markdown, or for those
who are rendering markdown documents in something other than HTML.

Note: To allow specific HTML elements, use the 'allowed_elements' parameter.

## MD034 - Bare URL used | 使用裸 URL

Tags: links, url

Aliases: no-bare-urls

This rule is triggered whenever a URL is given that isn't surrounded by angle
brackets:

```markdown
For more information, see https://www.example.com/.
```

To fix this, add angle brackets around the URL:

```markdown
For more information, see <https://www.example.com/>.
```

Rationale: Without angle brackets, the URL isn't converted into a link in many
markdown parsers.

Note: if you do want a bare URL without it being converted into a link,
enclose it in a code block, otherwise in some markdown parsers it _will_ be
converted:

```markdown
`https://www.example.com`
```

## MD035 - Horizontal rule style | 水平规则样式

Tags: hr

Aliases: hr-style

Parameters: style ("consistent", "---", "***", or other string specifying the
horizontal rule; default "consistent")

This rule is triggered when inconsistent styles of horizontal rules are used
in the document:

```markdown
---

- - -

***

* * *

****
```

To fix this, ensure any horizontal rules used in the document are consistent,
or match the given style if the rule is so configured:

```markdown
---

---
```

Note: by default, this rule is configured to just require that all horizontal
rules in the document are the same, and will trigger if any of the horizontal
rules are different than the first one encountered in the document. If you
want to configure the rule to match a specific style, the parameter given to
the 'style' option is a string containing the exact horizontal rule text that
is allowed.

## MD036 - Emphasis used instead of a heading | 强调使用而不是标题

Tags: headings, headers, emphasis

Aliases: no-emphasis-as-heading, no-emphasis-as-header

Parameters: punctuation (string; default ".,;:!?")

This check looks for instances where emphasized (i.e. bold or italic) text is
used to separate sections, where a heading should be used instead:

```markdown
**My document**

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...

_Another section_

Consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
```

To fix this, use markdown headings instead of emphasized text to denote
sections:

```markdown
# My document

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...

## Another section

Consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
```

Note: this rule looks for single line paragraphs that consist entirely of
emphasized text.  It won't fire on emphasis used within regular text,
multi-line emphasized paragraphs, and paragraphs ending in punctuation.
Similarly to rule MD026, you can configure what characters are recognized as
punctuation.

## MD037 - Spaces inside emphasis markers |  重点标记内的空格

Tags: whitespace, emphasis

Aliases: no-space-in-emphasis

This rule is triggered when emphasis markers (bold, italic) are used, but they
have spaces between the markers and the text:

```markdown
Here is some ** bold ** text.

Here is some * italic * text.

Here is some more __ bold __ text.

Here is some more _ italic _ text.
```

To fix this, remove the spaces around the emphasis markers:

```markdown
Here is some **bold** text.

Here is some *italic* text.

Here is some more __bold__ text.

Here is some more _italic_ text.
```

Rationale: Emphasis is only parsed as such when the asterisks/underscores
aren't completely surrounded by spaces. This rule attempts to detect where
they were surrounded by spaces, but it appears that emphasized text was
intended by the author.

## MD038 - Spaces inside code span elements | 代码范围内的空格元素

Tags: whitespace, code

Aliases: no-space-in-code

This rule is triggered on code span elements that have spaces right inside the
backticks:

```markdown
` some text `

`some text `

` some text`
```

To fix this, remove the spaces inside the codespan markers:

```markdown
`some text`
```

Note: A single leading or trailing space is allowed if used to separate codespan
markers from an embedded backtick:

```markdown
`` ` embedded backtick``
```

## MD039 - Spaces inside link text | 链接文本中的空格

Tags: whitespace, links

Aliases: no-space-in-links

This rule is triggered on links that have spaces surrounding the link text:

```markdown
[ a link ](https://www.example.com/)
```

To fix this, remove the spaces surrounding the link text:

```markdown
[a link](https://www.example.com/)
```

## MD040 - Fenced code blocks should have a language specified | 受控代码块应具有指定的语言

Tags: code, language

Aliases: fenced-code-language

This rule is triggered when fenced code blocks are used, but a language isn't
specified:

````markdown
```
#!/bin/bash
echo Hello world
```
````

To fix this, add a language specifier to the code block:

````markdown
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo Hello world
```
````

## MD041 - First line in file should be a top level heading | 文件中的第一行应该是顶级标题

Tags: headings, headers

Aliases: first-line-h1

Parameters: level, front_matter_title (number; default 1, string; default "^\s*title:")

This rule is triggered when the first line in the file isn't a top level (h1)
heading:

```markdown
This is a file without a heading
```

To fix this, add a heading to the top of your file:

```markdown
# File with heading

This is a file with a top level heading
```

The `level` parameter can be used to change the top level (ex: to h2) in cases
where an h1 is added externally.

If front matter is present and contains a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)
`title` property (commonly used with blog posts), this rule will not report a
violation. To use a different property name in front matter, specify the text
of a regular expression via the `front_matter_title` parameter. To disable the
use of front matter by this rule, specify `""` for `front_matter_title`.

## MD042 - No empty links | 没有空链接

Tags: links

Aliases: no-empty-links

This rule is triggered when an empty link is encountered:

```markdown
[an empty link]()
```

To fix the violation, provide a destination for the link:

```markdown
[a valid link](https://example.com/)
```

Empty fragments will trigger this rule:

```markdown
[an empty fragment](#)
```

But non-empty fragments will not:

```markdown
[a valid fragment](#fragment)
```

## MD043 - Required heading structure | 必需的标题结构

Tags: headings, headers

Aliases: required-headings, required-headers

Parameters: headings, headers (array of string; default `null` for disabled)

> If `headings` is not provided, `headers` (deprecated) will be used.

This rule is triggered when the headings in a file do not match the array of
headings passed to the rule. It can be used to enforce a standard heading
structure for a set of files.

To require exactly the following structure:

```markdown
# Head
## Item
### Detail
```

Set the `headings` parameter to:

```json
[
    "# Head",
    "## Item",
    "### Detail"
]
```

To allow optional headings as with the following structure:

```markdown
# Head
## Item
### Detail (optional)
## Foot
### Notes (optional)
```

Use the special value `"*"` meaning "one or more unspecified headings" and set
the `headings` parameter to:

```json
[
    "# Head",
    "## Item",
    "*",
    "## Foot",
    "*"
]
```

When an error is detected, this rule outputs the line number of the first
problematic heading (otherwise, it outputs the last line number of the file).

Note that while the `headings` parameter uses the "## Text" ATX heading style for
simplicity, a file may use any supported heading style.

## MD044 - Proper names should have the correct capitalization | 正确的名称应具有正确的大小写

Tags: spelling

Aliases: proper-names

Parameters: names, code_blocks (string array; default `null`, boolean; default `true`)

This rule is triggered when any of the strings in the `names` array do not have
the specified capitalization. It can be used to enforce a standard letter case
for the names of projects and products.

For example, the language "JavaScript" is usually written with both the 'J' and
'S' capitalized - though sometimes the 's' or 'j' appear in lower-case. To enforce
the proper capitalization, specify the desired letter case in the `names` array:

```json
[
    "JavaScript"
]
```

Set the `code_blocks` parameter to `false` to disable this rule for code blocks.

## MD045 - Images should have alternate text (alt text) | 图像应具有替代文本（替代文字）

Tags: accessibility, images

Aliases: no-alt-text

This rule is triggered when an image is missing alternate text (alt text) information.
Alternate text is important for accessibility, describing the content of an image for
people who may not be able to see it.

Alternate text is commonly specified inline as:

```markdown
![Alternate text](image.jpg)
```

Or with reference syntax as:

```markdown
![Alternate text][ref]

...

[ref]: image.jpg "Optional title"
```

Guidance for writing alternate text is available from the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/alt/),
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute), and
[other locations](https://www.phase2technology.com/blog/no-more-excuses-definitive-guide-alt-text-field).
