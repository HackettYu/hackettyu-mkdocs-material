DNF is the successor to YUM which is now used in Fedora for installing and managing packages. DNF may replace YUM in the future on all RPM based Linux distributions.

原来不是所有的基础命令都安装在 linux 中，如 ps、sudo 都可能需要额外安装

/etc/passwd	Stores the user name, the uid, the gid, the home directory, the login shell etc
/etc/shadow	Stores the password associated with the users
/etc/group	Stores information about different groups on the system

Some of the commands which are used frequently to manage users/groups on Linux are following:

```bash
useradd - Creates a new user

passwd - Adds or modifies passwords for a user

usermod - Modifies attributes of an user

userdel - Deletes an user
